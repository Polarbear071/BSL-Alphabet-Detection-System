--------- FRONT END ---------
Add camera to the website
Organise the pages of the website
Add a home page
decide whether or not to add users (time dependant)

--------- BACK END ---------
Find a free AI API
Impliment the API
Create a database of all the AI training data
Train the AI
Test the AI against different people

--------- Write Up ---------
Research different types of AI and choose which one to use (probably useful to do before finding the API :p)
Write up each programming-based commit and explain the use for each of them and how they are actually helping (or not)
Avoid doing the write up because it's boring
